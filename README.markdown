## How do I install it?

If you have Adium installed, simply double-click the
paraphernalia.AdiumMessageStyle file. If you don’t have Adium, this won’t be
much use.

## I don’t like the included backgrounds

It’s easy to put in your own:

1. Right click → Show package contents for the .AdiumMessageStyle file (if
 you’ve  installed the theme, it’ll be at `~/Library/Application Support/Adium
 2.0/Message Styles/`)
2. Put your image in the `images` folder (`Contents/Resources`)
3. Go to the ‘Variants’ folder (`Contents/Resources`)
4. Make a copy of one of the CSS files (edit the name to describe your new
 image)
5. Edit the image name in the CSS file—be sure to leave in the `../images/`
 part
6. Restart Adium
